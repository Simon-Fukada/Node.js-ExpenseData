# Node.js-ExpenseData
## Expense tracker

### What it does?

Allows one to input expenses. Expenses will be stored in a database and statistics (mean, sum, standard deviation and count) will be generated from data. 
All data points will be displayed visually in a line graph. Also, there are pictures of my cat. 

### What was my Goal?

My goal with this project was to practice with technologies and build something cool, that might help me save money. 

Technologies used:

	1) Node.js - I wanted to build a simple server with node.js to get a better understanding of how to use the language to connect to databases and perform Http request/responses
	2) SQL server express - I wanted to practice with  Microsoft SQL server management studio and make new instances and databases. 
	3) Chart.js - I wanted to practice how to make data more visual. I chose chart.js. I found it pretty simple to use and really liked the aesthetic. 
	4) W3 schools - I wanted to get more familiar using some of W3 schools for styling the website. For example, the slide show gallery. 
	5) AJAX - I always like to practice using AJAX to pass and parse JSON data between the front and back-end of the website. 
	
	
### Reflection on Project?

It was great to make something with node.js, and I feel more comfortable installing packages with npm. I also better understand how the http package works and how to connect to SQL server Express with the mssql package. In the future I will definitely want to connect to a MySQL/MariaDB as well. In terms of SQL Server express, it is always helpful for me to re-enforce my SQL skills and become more familiar with the SQL server management environment. Particularly I was happy to practice making new instances. I also want to continue to practice how to generate visual representations of data. Another project for me would be using a framework like Express to build some kind of live chat or maybe video chat. I would also like to practice building REST services/micro-services as well. 

### Most Challenging aspect of project?

The connection between the database and node.js server was probably the most challenging aspect for me, but it felt so good when I finally got it working :) 

### Important note about connection to SQL server
For this to work SQL server browser service must be running and TCP/IP must be enabled in the SQL Server Configuration Manager.
